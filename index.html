  <h1> <strong>Hello World!</strong></h1>
    <h2>Pavel Parkhomey</h2>
    <p>I was born In Odessa Ukraine on December 19, 1997. I moved to United States In 2007, It was a big change for me moving to a country that I didn't know anything about, I didn't know any English that was the hardest part for me In school because I couldn't comunicate with any kids at that time. </p>
    <p> When I got out of school I worked at a store called Aldo USA, It was a great place of work because I could communicate with a lot of people every day. I gained a lot of communicating skills at that job. </p>
    <p>When summer came I had to quit my job at Aldo, because I had a lot of camps to attend as a counselor for kids at my church that's located down in Kent. </p>
    <p> After summer was over i had to move on in life so I looked into CodeFellows and now im here trying to make something out of my self.</p>
